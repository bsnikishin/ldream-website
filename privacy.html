                <p>Welcome to LDream ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

This content is sent to our secure servers for AI interpretation and image generation. Dream content is processed in real-time and is not permanently stored on our servers.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect certain information automatically, including:</p>
                <ul>

This data remains on your device and is not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly choose to share it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to LDream Premium, your purchase is processed through Apple's App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information. We only receive confirmation of your subscription status.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
                <ul>

                <h2>Data Processing and Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>To provide dream interpretation and visualization services, we use the following third-party AI services:</p>

                    <li><strong>Fal.ai:</strong> For AI-generated dream visualization images</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you submit a dream for interpretation, your dream description is sent to these services through our secure backend. These providers process your data according to their respective privacy policies. We do not share your personal identity with these services.</p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                <p><strong>Server-side:</strong> Dream descriptions sent for interpretation are processed in real-time and are not permanently stored on our servers. Any temporary data is automatically deleted after processing.</p>
                <p><strong>Device-side:</strong> Your dream journal entries and generated content remain stored locally on your device until you choose to delete them. Deleting the app will remove all local data.</p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
                    <li>Secure API authentication</li>
                    <li>Regular security audits</li>
                    <li>Access controls and monitoring</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
